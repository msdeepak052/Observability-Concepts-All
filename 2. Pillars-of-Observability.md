## **Three Pillars of Observability** — **Logs**, **Metrics**, and **Traces** — in **detail**, with **real Kubernetes examples** and **real-world scenarios**.

---

## 🚀 1. LOGS

### ✅ What are Logs?

Logs are **immutable, timestamped text records** generated by applications and systems to describe what they’re doing at any given time.

### 🔍 Characteristics:

* Human-readable or structured (JSON)
* Great for **debugging errors**
* Often stored in **centralized systems** (like Elasticsearch)

---

### 🔧 Kubernetes Example:

```bash
kubectl logs my-app-pod
```

```log
[ERROR] Database connection failed: timeout after 10s
```

This tells you that the application **tried to connect to the database and failed** — no guessing required.

---

### 📘 Real-World Use Case:

#### 📉 Problem: Login Service not working

* **User** complains they can’t log in.
* You check logs using:
  `kubectl logs login-api-pod`

```log
[WARN] JWT token missing from header
[ERROR] Authentication failed: token invalid
```

#### 💡 Insight:

* Log tells you the exact issue: Token was missing or malformed.

#### 🔍 Without Logs:

You would have no clue unless you attach a debugger or start guessing the logic.

---

## 📊 2. METRICS

### ✅ What are Metrics?

Metrics are **numerical data points** collected over time. They’re great for **monitoring trends**, setting **alerts**, and identifying **performance bottlenecks**.

### 🔍 Characteristics:

* Lightweight
* Aggregated over time
* Stored in **time-series databases** (like Prometheus)

---

### 🔧 Kubernetes Example:

```yaml
# Prometheus metrics exposed at endpoint
http_requests_total{app="login-api",status="500"} 15
container_cpu_usage_seconds_total{container="login-api"} 110.5
```

This shows:

* 15 HTTP 500 errors
* 110.5 seconds of CPU consumed

---

### 📘 Real-World Use Case:

#### 📉 Problem: API latency increased suddenly

* **Grafana dashboard** shows spike in:

  * `http_request_duration_seconds`
  * `CPU usage`

#### 💡 Insight:

* It’s correlated with a new deployment or increased load.
* Helps SREs **scale pods**, or **revert a release**.

---

### 📈 Metrics Examples in K8s:

| Metric                         | What it Tells You                       |
| ------------------------------ | --------------------------------------- |
| `container_memory_usage_bytes` | Memory usage per container              |
| `http_requests_total`          | Traffic received                        |
| `kube_pod_status_phase`        | Pod state (Running, Pending, CrashLoop) |
| `node_cpu_utilization`         | Node-level CPU utilization              |

---

## 🔗 3. TRACES

### ✅ What are Traces?

Traces **follow a single request** across distributed services, capturing how much time it spends in each microservice or function.

### 🔍 Characteristics:

* Helps debug **latency and dependencies**
* Shows the **call chain**
* Useful in **microservices**

---

### 🔧 Kubernetes Example (Using Jaeger):

```json
{
  "traceID": "1234abcd",
  "spans": [
    {"service": "frontend", "duration": 10ms},
    {"service": "auth", "duration": 40ms},
    {"service": "db", "duration": 300ms}
  ]
}
```

You see that the **database is slow**, not the frontend.

---

### 📘 Real-World Use Case:

#### 📉 Problem: Checkout takes 3s to respond

* You look at Jaeger trace
* Shows:

  * Frontend → Payment Gateway → DB
  * DB call alone takes 2.5s

#### 💡 Insight:

Optimize DB query or add caching.

---

### 🔁 How Traces Are Collected:

* Use **OpenTelemetry SDK**
* Instrument services to add **trace context**
* Use **Jaeger/Zipkin** for visualization

---

## 📦 Combined Example in Kubernetes (Real Case)

### Scenario: User Registration is Slow and Failing

| Step | What You Use | What You Find                            |
| ---- | ------------ | ---------------------------------------- |
| 1️⃣  | **Logs**     | Error in connecting to `email-svc`       |
| 2️⃣  | **Metrics**  | High error rate & latency in `email-svc` |
| 3️⃣  | **Traces**   | Trace shows 5-second delay in email-svc  |

> 🔧 Final Diagnosis: Email service was stuck on an external SMTP call.

Sure Deepak! Below are **real-world microservices-based observability examples** across the three pillars — **logs**, **metrics**, and **traces**, with each scenario involving a Kubernetes deployment.

---

## 🧩 Scenario 1: **Order Processing Delay in an E-commerce App**

### 💡 Microservices Involved:

* `frontend`
* `cart-service`
* `order-service`
* `payment-service`
* `inventory-service`

---

### 🔍 Observability Breakdown:

#### 🔸 Logs:

* From `order-service`:

```log
[ERROR] Payment declined for order ID 12345
[INFO] Retrying payment for order ID 12345
```

* From `payment-service`:

```log
[WARN] External payment gateway timed out
```

➡️ **Logs help you identify failed external dependency**.

---

#### 🔸 Metrics:

* Prometheus Alert: High latency on `POST /process-payment`
* Metric:

  ```promql
  rate(http_request_duration_seconds_sum{job="payment-service", method="POST"}[1m])
  ```

➡️ **Metrics reveal rising latency trend over time**.

---

#### 🔸 Traces:

* Jaeger trace for order ID `12345` shows:

```
Frontend → Cart → Order → Payment (3000ms) → Inventory
```

➡️ Trace confirms **bottleneck is in `payment-service`**, especially during peak hours.

---

### 🎯 Final Insight:

* External payment gateway is the root cause.
* Solution: Add **retry with backoff**, use **circuit breaker**, or **fallback mechanism**.

---

## 🧩 Scenario 2: **Random Failures in User Login**

### 💡 Microservices Involved:

* `frontend`
* `auth-service`
* `user-profile-service`

---

### 🔍 Observability Breakdown:

#### 🔸 Logs:

```log
[INFO] User login attempted with email: abc@example.com
[ERROR] JWT validation failed – token expired
```

➡️ Indicates user sessions are expiring quickly.

---

#### 🔸 Metrics:

```promql
rate(http_requests_total{status="401", job="auth-service"}[5m])
```

Shows spike in `401 Unauthorized` responses from `auth-service`.

---

#### 🔸 Traces:

Trace from Jaeger:

```
Frontend → Auth (fail) – no call to user-profile-service
```

➡️ Confirms issue lies **only in auth layer**, others untouched.

---

### 🎯 Final Insight:

* Misconfigured token expiration time (5 minutes instead of 30 minutes).
* Fix in config file or re-issue token logic.

---

## 🧩 Scenario 3: **Inventory Not Updating After Purchase**

### 💡 Microservices Involved:

* `order-service`
* `inventory-service`
* `notification-service`

---

### 🔍 Observability Breakdown:

#### 🔸 Logs:

From `inventory-service`:

```log
[WARN] Skipped update for product ID 987: No matching order found
```

From `order-service`:

```log
[INFO] Order placed: Product ID 987, Qty: 1
```

➡️ Race condition or missing message in communication.

---

#### 🔸 Metrics:

* Drop in:

  ```promql
  rate(inventory_updates_total[5m])
  ```

➡️ Inventory updates per minute decreased post-deployment.

---

#### 🔸 Traces:

Trace shows:

```
Order → Inventory (no span) → Notification
```

➡️ Missing span to `inventory-service` — **message wasn’t delivered**.

---

### 🎯 Final Insight:

* Bug in async Kafka consumer or broken connection.
* Fix via retry logic or monitor **Kafka lag** via metrics.

---

## 🧩 Bonus Scenario: **Canary Deployment Gone Wrong**

### 💡 Services:

* `search-service` v1 (stable)
* `search-service` v2 (canary)

---

### 🔍 Observability Breakdown:

#### 🔸 Logs:

```log
[ERROR] Search query failed for input: "@@#$$"
```

In v2 logs only — parser bug in new version.

---

#### 🔸 Metrics:

Prometheus metric:

```promql
rate(http_requests_total{version="v2", status="500"}[1m])
```

Spiked after rollout to 10% traffic.

---

#### 🔸 Traces:

Trace shows v2 spans taking longer, or failing at `query-parsing` step.

---

### 🎯 Final Insight:

* Bug in v2 input validation
* Rolled back using traffic split (Istio VirtualService)

---
